# SiTH

#### This is a novel Eco-hydrological model (SiTH, Simple Terrestrial Hydrosphere) developed for estimating the essential variables associated with terrestrial water cycle, which is based on the scheme of the groundwater-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (GSPAC).

#### Here, we tested it at a alpine grassland site, Arou, where located in the northwest China.
